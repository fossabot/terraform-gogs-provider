# terraform-gogs-provider

This is a simple plugin for [Terraform](https://terraform.io) to test out writing [custom providers](https://www.terraform.io/guides/writing-custom-terraform-providers.html) in Go, specifically against the [Gogs](https://gogs.io) API.

This plugin/provider makes use of the [Gogs SDK](https://github.com/go-gogs/go-sdk) to make all API calls.
